HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN
------------------------------------
To compile, extract the enclosed files to the desired folder.
Open the command prompt and change directory to the specified
folder and type "make Labassignment4".

************************************
HOW TO USE
------------------------------------
This program uses the input arguments to search through a specified
range with a specified number of threads.
In the command prompt change directory to the folder "LabAssignment4"
is in, and type "./Labassignment4 <Int1> <Int2>", where <Int1> is the
number of threads desired, and <Int2> is the desired range. It'll
proceed to output all primes within the range.
Note: Make sure <Int2> is divisible by <Int1>.
Note2: Output can be messy.
